LLM - A neural network trained on large text datasets to generate human-like responses
Agent - An AI entity that performs specific actions autonomously based on user instructions or goals
Prompt - the input text or instruction provided to an AI model that defines task
System prompt / Role - A hidden or initial instruction that defines the AI model’s behavior, tone, and constraints
Context window - the maximum amount of text (in tokens) that an AI model can consider at once when generating a response
Hallucination — a phenomenon when an AI model produces false or made-up information.
Vibe coding - adjusting a pre-trained AI model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to improve performance.
RAG - Combining retrieval of factual documents with generation by LLMs.
Vector database - a specificialized type of database enabling semantic search
Fine-Tuning — adjusting a pre-trained AI model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to improve performance
